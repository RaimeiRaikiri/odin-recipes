I will be practicing my HTML knowledge by creating a basic recipe website.
it will contain an index page and have links to a few recipes using hyperlinks using the <a> tag and the "href" attribute.
in the recipes themselves i will add a link back to the index using the same techinques. I will also include lists on the recipe pages to show the recipes using the <ul> and <ol> tags.
